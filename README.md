The ASK-ME application was developed with a focus on web-based learning styles and mental health assessment. Its backbone was created through the implementation of a robust back-end infrastructure using PHP. Optimized database structures were crafted to efficiently manage user information and assessment data. Detailed assessment data of each student can be viewed by the teacher within the ASK-ME teacher dashboard. This functionality allows teachers to access comprehensive and specific assessment results for individual students. The website also facilitates real-time, anonymous consultations with guidance counselors, providing users the opportunity to engage in immediate, confidential discussions.![1702146612576](https://github.com/raoulhakim/ASK-ME-Web-Based-Learning-Style-and-Mental-Health-Assesment-Platform/assets/95678811/4e162fd2-4a1a-4bd9-9aeb-1fb4926070fe)
